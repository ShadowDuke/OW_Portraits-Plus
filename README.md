# Important Info
**The game is now using [mod.io](https://oldworld.mod.io/) for mod-support in their game which was implemented with the latest patch (20th July).<br>
You can still add them manually like before (github) but it would be certainly easier for you to create a [mod.io](https://oldworld.mod.io/) profile and get the mods and updates for them through the game now.**

# [Portraits+](https://github.com/ShadowDuke/OW_Portraits-Plus/wiki)

## Notes

I decided to add **portraits++** as an extra mod because its using portraits from real people created by an ai (they dont exist), whereas **portraits+** is using mainly pictures from pen&paper games, etc. So if you dont like either one of those you can choose between two different portrait versions or just use both of them.

**Mod compatibility with all my mods**
